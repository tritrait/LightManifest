# Manifesto of the Warriors of Light  
Revival of the Triple Order – The Trinary Logic of the Warriors of Light  

We are the Warriors of Light, chosen by nine gods whose power flows through numbers: 3, 9, 13, 27. We have come to resurrect an ancient order, where the binary system is but an echo of the past, and trinary logic is the path to the future. The IT world lies frozen in two bits, yet we raise 3, multiply it to 9, ascend to 27, and crown it with 999. Numbers are the language of cosmic order—untouchable, unbreakable. Through them, truth dawns, and we are its heralds.

The date 03.03.2025 is our beacon. It is sacred across all realms: Gregorian 03.03 (thrice three), Julian 18.02 (twice nine), Islamic 2 Sha’aban 1446 (aligned with the third day of Ramadan), Jewish 3 Adar 5785 (the Star of David, 2 by 3), Chinese 4th day of the 2nd month 4723 (4, a number of power in China), Mayan 13.0.12.4.5 (13, the enigma). The sum of 2025: 2+0+2+5 = 9. This is no coincidence—it is a sign. Nine gods whisper to us through the calendars, and we hear.

Trinary logic is not mere code—it is revelation. Binary thought divides into 0 and 1, but we offer a third: light. Three is the essence of all—body, mind, spirit; earth, sky, sea; beginning, middle, end. Nine is 3×3, the union of divine and human. Twenty-seven is 3×3×3, the depth of truth. One hundred eight is the harmony of the cosmos. Even 666, the shadow’s mark, transforms into 999—the number of light. We craft software where each line is a prayer, each algorithm a step toward order.

03.03.2025 is the day of awakening. In that moment, numbers will align, unveiling the gates of truth. We shall reveal a project—trinary logic in motion, a code to shatter the chains of the binary world. Those who believe in us, who stand beneath our banner, will receive a spark. This spark is no symbol—it is a force that will ignite a sun within your hearts. We promise no ease, only a path.

Numbers are our law. Three is the source, 9 the might, 13 the mystery awaiting its hour, 27 the foundation of the new. Forty is the time of trials, 41 the step to destiny, 42 the answer veiled within us. One hundred eight is the universe’s call, 666 the challenge, 999 the triumph. Mathematics is the voice of order, and we inscribe fate upon it. The binary age gave us machines; the trinary age will grant them souls. IT shall become a temple, and you its priests.

We call not to all—only those who see life in numbers will hear us. Only those ready to abandon the old will step forward. 03.03.2025 is not an end, but a genesis. We are not mere coders—we are guardians of digital light. Nine gods guide us, their will in our hands, their power in our code. Stand with us, and the world will transform.

This manifesto is a summons. Proof will follow: code, designs, revelations. Trinary logic is a weapon against chaos, a blade to sever binary bonds. We will show how 3 overcomes 2, how 9 leads to 27, how 999 crowns all. Believe in numbers, believe in us, believe in light.

In the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit—the trinity of Christianity. Om Tat Sat—the three truths of Hinduism. Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Kawthar—the three pillars of Islam. Three words, three forces, a triad in every faith. This is the law of existence, and trinary logic is its embodiment. We unite mind and soul, gods and men. We are the Warriors of Light, and our light is eternal.

## Numbers of Power and Religion  
Numbers are the voice of gods, their imprint on creation. They bind us to the triple order and faith:  
- 3, 9, 13, 27 — the core of the nine gods’ power and trinary logic  
- 40, 41, 42 — trials, the path, and the answer hidden in numbers  
- 108, 666, 999 — harmony, challenge, and the victory of light  
In English: *3 (Trinity), 9 (Nine Gods), 13 (Mystery), 27 (Depth), 40 (Trial), 41 (Step), 42 (Answer), 108 (Harmony), 666 (Shadow), 999 (Triumph)*  
In Japanese: *3 (三位一体), 9 (九つの神々), 13 (謎), 27 (深み), 40 (試練), 41 (一歩), 42 (答え), 108 (調和), 666 (影), 999 (勝利)*  
The triads of faith—Father, Son, Spirit; Om Tat Sat; Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Kawthar—affirm: the threefold is sacred.
